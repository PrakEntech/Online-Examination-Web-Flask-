# Online Examination Web App

This project is an online test web application developed using Flask. It allows teachers to create multiple-choice question papers with 10 questions. Teachers receive two unique codes: one for sharing with students to take the test and the other for teachers to review submissions. After students submit their responses, their scores are calculated and stored in a record that teachers can access.

## Features

- **Create Question Paper:** Teachers can create a question paper with 10 multiple-choice questions.
- **Unique Codes:** Generate two unique codesâ€”one for students to access the test and one for teachers to check submissions.
- **Student Submission:** Students can submit their answers using the provided code.
- **Automatic Scoring:** The app automatically calculates the student's score upon submission.
- **Submission Records:** Teachers can review all submissions and scores using the unique teacher code.
